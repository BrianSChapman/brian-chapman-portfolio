# <Brian Chapman Portfolio 1st Iteration>

## Description

As I learn new skills throughout the course, it's important to create a benchmark - to document where I've gone and where I'm going. This is the first iteration of what I hope will be polished and interview-worthy portfolio of my work throughout my time at the Penn Bootcamp. I will touch back on this to write it more efficiently and put work that I'm proud to share as I move closer to my web development goals.

## Installation

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
