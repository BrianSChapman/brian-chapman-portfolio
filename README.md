# <Brian Chapman Portfolio First Iteration>

## Description

As I learn new skills throughout the course, it's important to create a benchmark - to document where I've gone and where I'm going. This is the first iteration of what I hope will be polished and interview-worthy portfolio of my work throughout my time at the Penn Bootcamp. I will touch back on this to write it more efficiently and put work that I'm proud to share as I move closer to my web development goals.
